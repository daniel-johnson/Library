# My Library - Books that I am reading, or have read.

### The Social Skills Guidebook: Manage Shyness, Improve Your Conversations, and Make Friends, Without Giving Up Who You Are.
If you have _any_ level of social anxiety or difficulty, read this book. His [blog](https://www.succeedsocially.com/thesocialskillsguidebook) also has a lot of really good, specific content. I recommend at least poking through his blog.

### Zen and the Art of Archery
A european in Japan,ndin order to learn zen he studies archery. I've read about meditation and mindfullness stuff,
This book feels like someone walking me through how they learned it, with no nonsense. 

### Being Mortal
The name really says all you need to know: Being Mortal - Medicine, and what really matters in the end.
Highly recommended.

### The Ethical Slut
Just amazing. I love how they value communication and openness. If you're polyamorous, asexual, straight and vanilla, bisexual, or whatever, this book is amazing and has something for everyone.

### Tartine Bread
Bread porn. If you've ever wanted to make sourdough bread, their first recipe called country loaf, is the best. The best.



### The Dispossessed - An Ambiguous Utopia
The author, Ursula K Le Guin, is on of my favorite. This book is my favorite of hers.

### Guns, Germs, and Steel - The Fates of Human Societies
From the begginings of agriculture, to the first civilazations, to today, why did some cultures thrive and dominate while others stayed in the stone age? A brilliant book that will explain the last 50,000 years of human history in a digestible way.
It took me a year to get through this, because I'd stop, then pick it up again later.

### Letters to a Young Poet
An older poet's correspondance with a younger. I had read a few of his quotes online and I had to read this. Here are some samples of his quotes (not all from this book)
* This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.
* It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be a reason the more for us to do it.
* Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave.
* Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.
* I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.

### Anathem
A big book. About a human society where a 'religious' order preserved the maths and sciences through their dark ages. Been getting through it slowly. 


### Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays - Meditations
A classic stoic work. It's the private journal of a roman emperor.


### Time Enough for Love
A classic for me, I read this in high school with other Heinlen works. Sci-Fi where some people can go through regenerative therapy, and don't have to die.


### Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays - Meditations



### Crytponomicon
Haven't read it yet. Supposed to be classic, relatively modern Sci-Fi.
