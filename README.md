Books that I am reading, or have read.

### The Social Skills Guidebook: Manage Shyness, Improve Your Conversations, and Make Friends, Without Giving Up Who You Are.
If you have _any_ level of social anxiety or difficulty, read this book. His [blog](https://www.succeedsocially.com/thesocialskillsguidebook) also has a lot of really good, specific content. I highly recommend at least poking through his blog.

### Being Mortal
Written by a doctor, discussing modern medicine's clinical approach and how it's failing many end of life patients.
What got me was hearing about so many people at the end of their lives. He tells about their priorities and how it guides their treatment. It got me crying.

### The Ethical Slut
Just amazing. I don't care if you're polyamorous, asexual, straight and vanilla, bisexual, or whatever, this book is amazing and has something for everyone.

### Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays - Meditations
A classic stoic work. It's the private journal of a roman emperor. Don't get carried away caught in the past, or worrying about the future. Live in this moment, right now.

### Guns, Germs, and Steel
From the begginings of agriculture, to the first civilazations, to today, why did some cultures thrive and dominate while others stayed in the stone age? A brilliant book that will explain the last 50,000 years of human history in a digestible way.
It took me a year to get through this, because I'd stop, then pick it up again later.

### Letters to a Young Poet
An older poet's correspondance with a younger. I had read a few of his quotes online, and I had to read this. Here are some samples of his quotes (not all from this book)
* This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.
* It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be a reason the more for us to do it.
* Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave.
* Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.
* I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.

### Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance
Highly recommended by a friend I respect. I plan on reading it summer 2018 while travelling.

### Time Enough for Love
A classic for me, I read this in high school with other Heinlen works. Sci-Fi where some people can go through regenerative therapy, and don't have to die. Only slightly incestual.



### Catcher in the Rye
Supposed to be a classic. I got 1/3 of the way through and didn't finish...

### Crytponomicon
Haven't read it yet. Supposed to be classic, relatively modern Sci-Fi.
