# My Library - Books that I am reading, or have read.

### Being Mortal
I highly recommend. The title is perfect:
> Being Mortal - Medicine, and what really matters in the end

### Tartine Bread
It's more than a cook book, it's poetry. A love story between a man and bread.
Read up to the end of the first recipe, the country loaf.

### The Dispossessed - An Ambiguous Utopia
My favorite book from my favorite author.

### Time Enough for Love
One of my high school favorites. A strain of long lived humans have the technology to regenerate their youth. This is the story of the oldest man in the galaxy.  

### Guns, Germs, and Steel - The Fates of Human Societies
> From the begginings of agriculture, to the first civilazations, to today, why did some cultures thrive and dominate while others stayed in the stone age? A brilliant book that will explain the last 50,000 years of human history in a digestible way.

A long book, it took me a year of reading it on and off. Worth it.




### TheSocial Skills Guidebook: Manage Shyness, Improve Your Conversations, and Make Friends, Without Giving Up Who You Are.
If you have _any_ level of social anxiety or difficulty, I recommend this. His [blog](https://www.succeedsocially.com/thesocialskillsguidebook) also has a lot of really good, specific content.

### Letters to a Young Poet
An older poet's correspondance with a younger. I read a few of his quotes online and I had to read this. Some his quotes (not all from this book)
* It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be a reason the more for us to do it.
* Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave.
* I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.
* This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.

### The Ethical Slut
Knowing what you want, being open, and communicating are key to any relationship. This is true across orientation, relationship type, and relationship status.

### Anathem
A big book. About a human society where a 'religious' order preserved the maths and sciences through their dark ages. Been getting through it slowly. 

Haven't read it yet. Supposed to be classic, relatively modern Sci-Fi.

### Marcus Aurelius, Gregory Hays - Meditations
A classic stoic work, the private journal of a roman emperor.

### Six Seasons: A New Way With Vegetables
Haven't read it yet.
